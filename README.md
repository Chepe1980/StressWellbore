# StressWellbore
Hoop stress concentration around the wellbore
This  code creates an interactive  web application for analyzing hoop stress distribution around a wellbore. The app combines 3D finite difference modeling and analytical Kirsch equations to visualize stress patterns, allowing users to adjust key parameters like wellbore geometry, depth range, geomechanical properties (overburden gradient, pore pressure, Poisson's ratio), and stress anisotropy through an intuitive sidebar interface. The application generates six interactive plots: 3D wellbore stress distribution, threshold-based stress concentration zones, circumferential stress variation at the wellbore wall, radial stress decay profiles, and 2D polar/Cartesian cross-sections. Designed for petroleum engineers and geomechanics professionals, it provides real-time visualization of how stresses evolve under different conditions, helping identify potential failure zones and optimize wellbore stability strategies. The code balances computational efficiency (using sparse matrices) with visualization quality, offering adjustable resolution settings to accommodate different hardware capabilities.
